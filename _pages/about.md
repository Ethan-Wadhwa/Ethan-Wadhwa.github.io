Hello! I am an aspiring Autonomous Systems and Controls engineer from Denver, Colorado. I graduated from the University of California San Diego with a Bachelors of Science in Astrophysics and a minor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I am deeply interested in researching aerospace system simulation, satellite and guidance system hardware design, and space system navigation control. I have experience working with hardware design from my time working as a research assistant for Simon's Observatory and have software experience from various class projects. Feel free to check out my projects page to see some of what I have worked on!

Aside from my career ambitions, I am an avid fan of the culinary arts and seek to further my cooking skills especially with grilling. I am also a huge fan of hiking in summer months and skiing in the winter when I can find time to get up to a good mountain. I am also a huge nerd and love reading sci fi or playing video games related to space or design (like KSP).
