I am an aspiring Autonomous Systems Design engineer from Denver, Colorado. I am interested in researching aerospace system simulation, guidance systems, navigation controls, and satellite design. I graduated from the University of California San Diego with a Bachelors of Science in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics and obtained a minor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I worked for several years with Simon's Observatory doing design work for test systems for the first Small Aperture Telescope used for observing the Cosmic Microwave Background.

Besides my research interests, I am a lover of the culinary arts, and seek to master my cooking abilities especially with grilling. I also love hiking in warmer months and skiing during winter months.
