We first developed algorithms to reduce our science frames by subtracting the bias and overscan area, multiplying by the gain obtained by flatfield images. We then developed an algorithm to identify and centroid star locations to accurately chart star locations on our CCD images. We then used the star locations from our images and queried the USNO-B1 to find the actual right ascension, declination, and location of the stars in our frame to convert from pixels to standard coordinates. Once the objects in our frame had been converted to standard coordinates, we can relate the locations of the observed asteroid across frames to quantify the velocity of the asteroid. </div> <h2> 1 Introduction </h2> <p>In astronomy, the celestial sphere is a tool used to chart the locations of celestial objects in the sky. The celestial sphere is a fixed projection of the sky onto a sphere with its equator along the same axis as the Earths. By charting celestial objects on this sphere, astronomers label objects’ coordinates on the fixed sphere in terms of their right ascension (degrees to the left or right of the celestial meridian) and declination (degrees above or below the celestial equator). Star fields are the backgrounds of most astronomical images taken; they are the fields of visible stars in the area behind a source being observed. Star fields are used for a much more important task than being background noise behind a desired source; they allow astronomers to find the exact location of a source on the celestial sphere. The star field in an image of a source can be used to query databases containing the locations of known objects on the celestial sphere to convert the image of a source from pixels to celestial coordinates. By doing this, astronomers can accurately chart the motions of astronomical bodies by their movement along the celestial sphere.</p> <h2> 2 Observing &amp; Data </h2> <h4> 2.1 Collecting Data </h4> <p>In this lab, we collected our CCD images using the Direct Imaging Camera on the Nickel 1-m Telescope at the Lick Observatory. The telescope was accessed remotely by Physics 164 students directed by Dr. Quinn Konopacky on February 28th, 2022 from the UCSD Observational Astrophysics Lab Room. Several bias frames with the telescope shudder closed were taken, as well as dome flatfield images taken in each of the five possible filters (UBVRI). The main data used for this lab were CCD images taken by the physics 164 students of their chosen asteroids. For our group, C/D, we chose to observe 44 Nysa, so three sets of five CCD images of 44 Nysa were taken at different times throughout the observing period, two sets in the R filter and one set taken in the V filter. The full list of data files used can be found in appendix 6.1.</p> <h4> 2.2 Catalog Databases </h4> <p>In this lab we rely on the USNO-B1 database to chart the predicted locations of stars in our frames’ star fields. The USNO-B1 is a catalog of ~1 billion celestial objects derived from ~3.6 billion observations taken by the US Naval Observatory (USNO), all with magnitudes less than V=21. This catalog also contains the approximate motion of the charted celestial objects to an accuracy of approximately 0.2 arc seconds to the star’s locations in the year 2000. Movement of each celestial body per year or ‘epoch’ has been calculated in this catalog as well, allowing us to use the predicted locations of stars on our observing data (02/28/2022) to relate our CCD images to actual celestial coordinates.</p> <h4> 2.3 Displaying Data </h4> <p>Let us take a closer look at the first and last 44 Nysa frames taken in the R band. To be able to properly view our CCD images, we must first perform a bias subtraction, overscan removal, and flatfield correction to display our images in their clearest form. Once this has been done, we can observe several frames to view the movement of our chosen asteroid over time. As seen in figure 1 below, the chosen object (44 Nysa) clearly moves a significant distance within the time between these two frames being taken. Additionally, in this image we can see the same star field in the background of both frames, telling us we can use these stars to find the exact right ascension and declination of 44 Nysa at the times of these frames.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/fig1_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="fig1" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 1: The first (left) and last (right) reduced 44 Nysa frames shown with gray color scale plotting to be able to better visualize objects present in the frame. The darker the points, the more intensity observed on those pixels. A bad column of detectors is present at roughly x=252, causing the inconsistency along that column. The largest dark point visible in both images is 44 Nysa. </div> <h2> 3 Data Reduction and Methods </h2> <h4> 3.1 Reduction of Astronomical Science Frames </h4> <p>The first step in reducing our data to be usable for our calculations is to remove the bias noise and overscan region, and to correct for pixel sensitivity using dome flatfields. For this dataset, we obtain a series of bias frames which can be averaged to use as a universal bias frame, and the overscan region is given in the header of each file. To make this process simpler, we first remove the bias and overscan from all frames before using the normalized flatfield frame to correct for pixel sensitivity in our science frames. To remove the overscan and bias from our frames, we subtract the averaged bias frame from our science frame then remove columns of the dataset in the overscan region of the frame. To correct for the gain in the pixel sensors using the normalized flatfield, we use a flatfield frame with bias and overscan removed and divide by the median value of said frame to obtain the gain.</p> <p>We can multiply our bias and overscan removed science frames by the pixel gain to obtain our fully reduce science frames. The reduced frames can be seen in figure 1, with python functions used to perform this reduction in appendix 6.3.1, 6.3.2.</p> <h4> 3.2 Identifying &amp; Centroiding Star locations </h4> <p>To convert from x pixels and y pixels to standard coordinates we must first define which points in our frame are stars. To do this, we locate potential stars by adding all pixels with analog-digital units (ADU) counts above 1.5 times the median ADU count of the frame to a list. To account for any pixels that detected low magnitude stars or that picked up light from any other source, we reduce our list of every pixel location that has a high intensity to only the pixels at the center of pixel clusters with high detected intensities. To do this, we search through a square of a defined size around each high intensity pixel and if there are less than a specified amount of other high intensity pixels in this area, we remove the pixel from our list. For pixels that do have more than the limit of nearby bright pixels, we identify the approximate location of the star to be at the highest ADU count pixel in the area. The code for this can be found at appendix 6.3.3.</p> <p>By identifying general locations of stars, we are able to reduce our centroiding algorithm to just run in the areas of the general locations of the stars to find their exact centroids. We define the areas to perform a centroiding function to be a 20 pixel by 20 pixel square centered at the star locations identified on the frame. We then follow the centroiding algorithm for both x and y:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq1_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq1" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Where x is the x pixel value at index i, y is the y pixel value at index i, and I is the ADU count (intensity) at index i. The centroid values of each star give us the calculated center of each star in x and y pixels with error calculated by:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq2_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The centroiding function can be found at appendix 6.3.4, and is visualized in figure 2.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/fig2_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="fig2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 2: Identified Stars with counts over each star in the first 44 Nysa frame taken at 05:08:57.6, +20:58:51.4 at hour angle 21:00 on Feb 28, 2022. The brightest object marked with the number ‘2’ is 44 Nysa. </div> <h4> 3.3 Querying USNO-B1 Database to find Star Field Coordinates </h4> <p>Once we have our star locations in pixel coordinates, the next piece of information is the actual right ascension and declination of the stars. To find the actual celestial coordinates of our stars, we must first find our frames’ actual location on the celestial sphere. We find these coordinates by querying the USNO-B1 database with the right ascension and declination of the center of our frame obtained from the header of the data files. In order to access the USNO-B1 database, we import astroquery.vizier into our code. Vizier allows us to find the exact right ascension and declination of stars in the field of our image. We query Vizier with our frame coordinates, magnitude limit, number of stars, field of view dimensions, and year of observation. Vizier returns us a list of the celestial coordinates of any stars that meet our query condition. The code for querying USNO-B1 can be found at appendix 6.3.5.</p> <h4> 3.4 Converting Frame Coordinates from Pixels to Standard Coordinates </h4> <p>Once we have obtained the pixel centroids of the stars in our frame and the queried actual right ascension and declination of each star, we can perform a fit using a least squares approximation of our data to convert our frame coordinates from pixels to celestial coordinates. To convert from x and y pixel values to RA and DEC, we rely on the matrix equation:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq3_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq3" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>where x is our centroid objects’ pixel coordinate vector with the form (x , y , 1), X is our centroid objects’ celestial coordinate vector with the form (RA, DEC, 1), and T is our transformation matrix:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq4_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq4" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The (f/p) ratio in this matrix is the lens in the telescope’s focal distance (f=16480 mm) and the pixel size (p=0.0015mm). The six unknowns in this equation are our plate constants, with ai,j referring to the scale, shear, and orientation and x0 , y0 being our offset in pixels. We can find the values of the plate constants using least squares fitting. To find the plate constants, we must first write out our x=TX equation for the X matrix of the actual Ra and Dec of our stars and x being either the x pixel vector or y pixel vector. This gives us the matrix:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq5_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq5" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq6_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq6" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>And the version of this matrix for y has the an a vector of all y pixels and c=(a21 a22 y0) Using these equations, we can calculate the plate constants by finding the least distance between the points through the equation:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq7_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq7" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>By minimizing χ^2 , we can multiply both sides of a=Bc by the transpose of B and the inverse of B times transposed B to find our c vector values, giving us our plate constants.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq8_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq8" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>By performing this fit using both a vectors (both x and y pixel coordinate vectors) to find both c vector values, we obtain our two sets of plate constants that we can plug back into matrix T. The equation to convert from RA/DEC to pixel coordinates can be reversed to convert from pixel values to ra/dec by multiplying both sides by the inverse of T to give us the equation:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq9_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq9" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>We plug each individual pixel coordinate into this equation with the coordinate vector of the form x = [x pixel, y pixel, 1] to obtain our right ascension (α) and declination (δ) coordinates for our centroid object locations with the form X = [α , δ, 1]. Once we have obtained the celestial coordinates of our objects, it is a relatively straightforward conversion from celestial coordinates to standard coordinates:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq10_11lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq10_11" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Where X,Y are our standard coordinates, α_0 is the right ascension of the center of our frame and δ_0 is the declination of the center of our frame. The code used to perform this conversion can be found in appendix 6.3.6 and 6.3.7. This can be visualized in figure 3 shown in appendix 6.2.</p> <h2> 4 Calculations and Modeling </h2> <p>Now that we have our coordinates for our frames in both RA/DEC and standard coordinates, we can examine two frames taken at different times to determine the change in RA and DEC of the asteroid we chose to observe, 44 Nysa.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/fig3_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="fig3" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 3: (Left) Shows the first and last 44 Nysa frames taken plotted in standard coordinates (Right) Shows the first and last 44 Nysa frames taken plotted in celestial coordinates.

The celestial coordinates of 44 Nysa in our first frame are 𝑅𝐴_1 = 77.2537212 ± 0.0000017°, 𝐷𝐸𝐶_1 = 20.9839658 ± 0.0000004°. The celestial coordinates of 44 Nysa in our second frame are 𝑅𝐴_2 = 77.2738905 ± 0.0000049°, 𝐷𝐸𝐶_2 = 20.9881811 ± 0.0000006°. The errors in RA and DEC were calculated using equation (2). By finding the difference in the right ascensions and declinations, we can find the total angle the asteroid has moved by using the pythagorean theorem:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/eq12_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="eq12" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>We find the change in RA to be: ∆𝑅𝐴 = 0.0201693 ± 0.0000076° and the change in DEC to be: ∆𝐷𝐸𝐶 = 0.0042153 ± 0.0000010°.

The largest sources of errors in our measurements come mainly from the discrepancy in our time measurements, the small error from the centroiding function, and the small error in the pixel to celestial coordinate conversion. However, we are still able to calculate the proper motion with an error of ~5% of our established measurement. More precise calculations of the proper motion could be obtained from more measurements of 44 Nysa, each in 1 hour intervals on the same night.</p> <p>The proper motion of Nysa obtained from our observations does reveal several things about this asteroid. First and foremost, the proper motion being of this magnitude tells us the object we are observing must be relatively nearby as extremely distant objects’ proper motion is much smaller than the proper motion obtained for Nysa. The other quantity the proper motion tells us is the relative orbit of 44 Nysa in our solar system. The angle of 44 Nysa’s proper motion not being zero relative to the earth tells us that it orbits along a different axis than Earth’s around the sun. Improvements to this experiment would be measuring the parallax of the asteroid by taking simultaneous measurements of the star on both sides of the continental United States. The parallax of this asteroid would allow us to calculate the distance to it and thus using our proper motion and distance calculate the transverse velocity of this stellar object. Another improvement would be to create an algorithm to automatically match the queried star locations to the observed star locations for more accurate conversion from pixel coordinates to celestial coordinates. Overall, this lab yielded a measurement of the proper motion of 44 Nysa and several algorithms useful to many different applications in astrometry.</p> <h2> 6 Appendix </h2> <h4> 6.1 Data Files </h4> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/6.1_appendix_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="appendix1" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h4> 6.2 Figure 5 - USNO-B1 Query Compared to Observed Frame </h4> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/fig6_lab3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="fig5" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 3: (left) The first 44 Nysa frame’s centroid object locations converted to RA and DEC plotted against the actual star locations queried from USNO-B1.
